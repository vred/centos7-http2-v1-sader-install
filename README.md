# centos7-http2-v1-sader-install
A crude but serviceable shell script for a partial stack automated install featuring mainline/stable builds of OpenSSL/Python3/nginx to support HTTP/2 (w/ APLN support) to be used with recently installed CentOS 7 (minimal). For sysadmins who are staging for Python 3-based web frameworks and want HTTP/2 support in Cent OS7.
